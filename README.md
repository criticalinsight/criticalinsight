# 🧙🏾‍♂️ Critical Insight

> "Sovereignty is the ability to maintain context over time."

I am an engineer focused on **distributed systems**, **language design**, and **autonomous agentic architectures**. My work explores the intersection of localized resilience, deterministic identity, and reactive intelligence.

## 🚀 The Sovereign Stack

My primary research and development focus is on building a fully self-contained, local-first stack for intelligent systems.

| Project | Description | Tech Stack |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[GleamDB](https://github.com/criticalinsight/gleamdb)** | 🧠 **Analytical Datalog Engine.** A distributed, logic-based database featuring Native Sharding, Deterministic Identity, and Raft consensus. Built for high-read-throughput agentic workloads. | `Gleam`, `OTP`, `Mnesia` |
| **[Gswarm](https://github.com/criticalinsight/gswarm)** | 🐝 **Swarm Simulation Fabric.** A distributed runtime for autonomous trading agents. Demonstrates "Silicon Saturation" (10k+ ops/sec) and democratic partitioning. | `Gleam`, `GleamDB` |
| **[NERD](https://github.com/criticalinsight/nerd)** | 🧪 **Experimental Language.** A programming language designed for agentic workflows, featuring a Hickey-inspired runtime and sovereign memory models. | `Rust`, `Gleam` |

## 🛠️ Applications & Tools

| Project | Role |
| :--- | :--- |
| **[Amkabot](https://github.com/criticalinsight/amkabot)** | High-frequency arbitrage bot and market analysis tool. |
| **[Subs](https://github.com/criticalinsight/subs)** | Subscription management and recurring payment orchestration (formerly *Bouncer*). |
| **[Sly](https://github.com/criticalinsight/sly)** | CLI tool for rapid project scaffolding and context injection. |

## 🔭 Philosophy

My work is guided by specific architectural principles:
- **Local-First**: Systems should operate fully without internet, syncing when possible.
- **Deterministic Identity**: Data identity should be intrinsic to the content, not the location.
- **Agentic Sovereignty**: Software should own its lifecycle, protecting its state against external chaos.
